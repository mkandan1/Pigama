                            Think of this post as your uber-brief but thorough guide to everything you need to know about video editing. We’ll talk about putting together a script, adding the right kind of audio, formatting your video like a pro, and so much more. Let’s dive in.
                            An effective script should:

                            Have clear, audience-specific goals. What do you want your video to do? Who’s going to watch it? Getting super clear about the video’s purpose will help you present your message in a more engaging way.
                        </p>



                        <p>
                            Focus on a single idea at a time. Figure out what the key idea of your video is and focus on that. By sticking to one theme or problem at a time, you can create a tighter, more informative video.
                            Speak to your audience. A video is a conversation. When writing your script, think about what questions, thoughts, and feelings are going through the viewer’s mind and address them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Format your video like a pro
                            Just like you get all kinds of text documents, videos come in a pretty large variety of formats. The most common ones for online streaming are MP4, FLV, and WMV.

                            All three of these are supported by the main social media platforms and work well online. Wanna know more? We’ve got a whole post on how video formats work and why you should care.

                            However, you don’t have to worry about formats with Biteable. Your video exports in MP4, a format supported by pretty much every platform worth its salt.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            Organize your footage. “You have to be organized,” says Tiffani Bauer, video producer at Descript. “Starting off by organizing your stuff straight out of the camera is great.” Keeping your video clips in order will allow you to quickly find the pieces you need when you need them. Decide on a management strategy and file structure, and keep it consistent. Create folders for your project on your device and make subfolders for your raw clips depending on their type, or where they belong in your edit.
                            Make a plan. It doesn’t have to be overly elaborate, but you should have a good idea about what your project will look and sound like. Create an outline of your vision, or better yet, make a shot list detailing the visual and the audio components of every scene. If you want to include voice over or narration, write a script by outlining the points you want to make, then writing them out to sound natural.</p>



                        <p> Read it out, make adjustments, and repeat until it sounds right. Keep your writing concise, and make sure that whoever is reading the script practices in advance.
                            Choose clips that show important action. Trim clips to include only the parts you need. Ask yourself: What does my story need? “You don’t have to keep everything,” says Tiffani. “If it’s not working in the edit, feel free to drop it.” It’s normal to be precious about your footage, especially if it took a lot of work to record, but a good editor can make tough choices for the sake of the overall project.
